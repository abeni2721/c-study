/*Variables = we use variables to temporarily store data.
variables are the name of location in the memory we can store different data types in variable.
To declare in variable in c++
first we have to specify the data type.
We use int to store whole numbers.
We use double to store decimal  numbers.
Variable declaration conventions
we dont have to use f1 and f2 or fs 
*/
/*
constants: we use constants if we do not want to change the value of the variable.

 */
 /*
 Naming conventions
 1. we have to use lower case letter to name.
 2. If we have multiple name we have to separate them by using underscore.
 3. we can capitalize the first letter of our variable name.
